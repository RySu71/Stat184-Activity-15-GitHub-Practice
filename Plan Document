Plan for repository and project

Project:
We will be looking at data sets and choosing which one that will suit what we want to do with it.
An interesting data set that has variability for assumptions, inferences, and possible correlation 
and causation statements. Wrangling data and tidying data, then producing tables and graphs/charts
for visual references. Explaining these tables and what someone can take away from these.

Repository Maintenence:
For setting up this repository, there are branches that will possibly be made different parts of the
project and such, however that is currently undetermined. Using the 'main' branch currently for most
information storage and commits. For maintenence, reviewing this repository on a daily basis to look
at the current status of it and where any information is. Checking commits and process for smooth
operations. Creating and editing the repository as is needed.
